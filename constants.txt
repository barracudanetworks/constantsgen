# Comments starting with # and blank lines are ignored.
# Lines ending in : start a section.
# Arguments outside brackets are required; those in brackets are not.
# Sections:
#  file:
#    file(s) in which constants and enums are to be found
#  constant:
#    source_name [destination_name]
#  enum:
#    source_name destination_name [source_value destination_value]...
#  manual:
#    name value

# An example:

file:
# Note that these paths are relative to this specification file
../path/to/file.c
../path/to/file.h

constant:
# Sections can have comments in them too.
AN_ABRVD_DFN A_NON_ABBREVIATED_NAME
# These constants are made from #defines
REASONABLE_CONSTANT

enum:
# Because C enum values almost always start with a type followed by
# an underscore, the value names have that before the first underscore,
# if any, removed, and are converted to lower-case.
frobulator_types_e FrobulatorType FROBULATOR_OBTUSE_NAME clearer_name
# Without this name override FROBULATOR_OBTUSE_NAME would become
# FrobulatorType.obtuse_name.
